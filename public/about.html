<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Nicky, also known as Raji. I've worked in the travel industry since leaving school and worked in several well known airlines and agents.
  My family consists of my mum, dad, 2 brothers, partner, sister in law and niece, between us we have 3 dogs.
  </p>

<p>During my time in the travel industry I had travelled to many beautiful destinations, soaking up the sun.
  Whilst working I decided to study IT as a back up if I ever needed a change, my passion for learning IT was further excellarated when I was given a dodgy laptop.
  I went on to study, PC 1 and 2 support, MCP and MCSE.

<p>I then got made redundant from Travel job, due to Covid and went onto getting a job in totally different industry, working on the Service Desk for just over a year, moving into doing Development.
  Now I am a Junior Developer working on Outsystems and learning now more new skills all the time
